  abstract  = "Nervous systems are composed of various cell types, but the
               extent of cell type diversity is poorly understood. We
               constructed a cellular taxonomy of one cortical region, primary
               visual cortex, in adult mice on the basis of single-cell RNA
               sequencing. We identified 49 transcriptomic cell types,
               including 23 GABAergic, 19 glutamatergic and 7 non-neuronal
               types. We also analyzed cell type-specific mRNA processing and
               characterized genetic access to these transcriptomic types by
               many transgenic Cre lines. Finally, we found that some of our
               transcriptomic cell types displayed specific and differential
               electrophysiological and axon projection properties, thereby
               confirming that the single-cell transcriptomic signatures can be
               associated with specific cellular properties.",

              biological data sets generated by high-throughput assays such as
              sequencing. However, most existing tools for interactive
              visualisation are limited to specific assays or analyses. Here,
              we present the iSEE (Interactive SummarizedExperiment Explorer)
              software package, which provides a general visual interface for
              exploring data in a SummarizedExperiment object. iSEE is directly
              compatible with many existing R/Bioconductor packages for
              analysing high-throughput biological data, and provides useful
              features such as simultaneous examination of (meta)data and
              analysis results, dynamic linking between plots and code tracking
              for reproducibility. We demonstrate the utility and flexibility
              of iSEE by applying it to explore a range of real transcriptomics
              and proteomics data sets.",
