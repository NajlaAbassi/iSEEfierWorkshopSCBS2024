### Description

Effectively exploring and visualizing omics data is one crucial step for uncovering new biological insights. [`iSEE`](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/iSEE), a Bioconductor package/Shiny App, offers a wealth of powerful features to help you visualize your data at any stage of the data analysis pipeline.

This workshop will cover some of the core functionalities of `iSEE`, as well as introducing [`iSEEfier`](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/iSEEfier), a Bioconductor package and `iSEE` extension, designed to simplify the setup of `iSEE` instances, making it easier to create customized visualization sessions. The participant will learn how to use `iSEE` and how to create tailored initial states with `iSEEfier` for diverse data exploration goals.

### Pre-requisites

-   Basic knowledge of R syntax
-   Familiarity with bulk or single-cell sequencing data
-   Familiarity with the `SummarizedExperiment` class
